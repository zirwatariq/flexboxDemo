# Flexbox Navigation
This exercise is a basic introduction to Flexbox layout. 

In this exercise you will:
- Implement features in code based on prototypes.
- Practice using Flexbox to layout the main navigation at larger screen sizes.
- Practice using media queries to implement a responsive design.

## Tasks
- **Preview**: Make sure you know what your goals are! 
	- Review the prototypes in the screenshots folder. 
	- Review the HTML code so that you understand the structure of the document. You will not need to edit the HTML code.
	- Go through the CSS and make sure you understand what all of the existing code does. 
		- *Add comments to leave yourself notes about what particular properties do*. I recommend using your developer tools to explore what is already present. You can toggle properties on and off to see what they do.
- **Style header for screens larger than 38rems**: You'll notice that the narrow screen design has already been implemented. Your job is to implement the design change that occurs at 38rems. 
	- You'll first make a two column design that includes the site identifier on the left and the nav on the right. These columns will not be equal.
	- Next you'll make sure the navigational list items are in a single row. *Hint: you'll have a flexbox inside of a flexbox.*

- **Make site live**
